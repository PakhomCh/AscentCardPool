1. Basic Principles
	1. General
		1. These rules apply to any game of Ascension.
		2. If a card's effect conflicts with the rules that follow, the effect takes precedence.
		3. If two rules or effects contradict each other, the prohibiting effect takes precedence.
		4. Effects that instruct to ignore a rule or effect take precedence over all other rules and effects.
		5. Ownership of a game component, game area, or other in-game object does not mean or affect the actual ownership of the objects mentioned above.
		6. Only Ascension game cards or their digital counterparts are used to play Ascension.
		7. Any references to cards in the following rules text refer specifically to Ascension cards suitable for playing Ascension.
	2. Players
		1. Each person in the game is considered a player.
		2. Depending on the game format (see Section 3), each player may have one or more other players as allies.
		3. If one of the allies wins the game, all of the winning player's allies also win the game.
		4. For each player, all other players who are not allies are considered opponents.
		5. All of the winning player's opponents lose the game.
		6. Each player must have a personal Ascension deck constructed according to these rules (see Section 4).
	3. Matches and Games
		1. Players play Ascension matches.
		2. The match format (see Section 3) is determined before the match begins and does not change until the match ends. The match format determines which cards may be used during the match and what structure the deck must adhere to.
		3. A match, depending on the format, the agreement of the players, and the rules of the event, may consist of one or more games.
		4. Regardless of the match format and number of players, each game of Ascension is played in one structure
		5. A minimum of two players participate in a match.
		6. The number of players participating in a match and their composition remains unchanged until the end of the match.
		7. During the game, players can retire from the game. They return to the game at the beginning of the next game.
		8. If a player retires from the game, all cards that he owned in the exclusive format are also removed from the game, and the effects created by him end. All cards from the decks of other players that he owned are also removed from the game.
		9. If all of a player's opponents are eliminated from the game, he wins the game.
		10. If the game is finished and no player has won, a draw is declared between all players, regardless of whether they retire from the game or not.
	4. Game Zones
		1. A game zone is an area of ​​the game space that is conventionally used by players to indicate that game components belong to one of them.
		2. The game space is divided into several game zones, each of which belongs to one or more of the following categories:
			1. Ordered Game Zone — A game zone in which the order of the cards that get into it is important, as a result of which the game objects in it cannot be reorganized (for example, the deck cannot be shuffled).
			2. Free Game Zone — A game zone in which the order of the cards that get into it is not important, as a result of which the game objects in it can be reorganized at any time.
			3. Individual Game Zone — A game zone that each player has. Each player is considered the owner of all of their individual game zones. All game objects in this zone belong to the owner of the zone.
			4. Common Game Zone — A game zone shared by several players. Such a zone has no owner. Each game object in this zone belongs to one of the players participating in the game.
			5. Open Play Zone — A play zone in which all players can see the exact contents of the zone at any time. If such a zone is also Ordered, all players can also see the order established in this zone.
			6. Closed Play Zone — A play zone in which no player can see the exact contents of the zone, but can see the exact number of game components in it at any time. Cards in such a zone are always face down.
			7. Private Play Zone — A play zone that is considered open to all its owners and closed to all other players.
		3. If an effect causes a game component to be in multiple play zones at once, the properties of their categories are applied to it in the following order:
			1. If a component is in both an Ordered Play Zone and an Unordered Play Zone, its physical location must reflect its location in the Ordered Zone.
			2. If a component is in both a private and public play area, its owners are all players who owned it before it entered the private play area and the players who own the aforementioned private play area.
			3. If a component is in both a closed and open play area, the component is considered "open".
			4. If a component is in both a closed and private play area, the component is considered "open" only for the owners of the aforementioned private play area.
			5. If a component is in both a private and open play area, the component is considered "open".
		4. If a component in one or more play areas is to be moved to another, first, effects that change play area affiliation are removed from it, then it is moved to the other play area, after which static effects (see Section 6) are applied to it again.
		5. When playing Ascension, the game space is divided into the following set of game zones:
			1. Main Deck - An ordered, individual, closed game zone belonging to each player in the game. At the beginning of the game, it contains the cards that the player will control during the game.
			2. The rules and game of Ascension often use the term drawing a card. If it is not specified which card to draw, it is assumed that the card is taken from the top of the main deck of the player drawing the card.
			3. Reinforcement Deck - A free, individual, open game zone belonging to each player in the game. At the beginning of the game, it contains auxiliary cards that the player will be able to bring into play during the game.
			4. Graveyard - A free, individual, open game zone belonging to each player in the game. At the beginning of the game, it is empty. As the game progresses, it will contain destroyed, played, and discarded cards.
			5. Oblivion — A free individual open play area belonging to each player in the game. Empty at the start of the game. Cards permanently removed from play go into it.
			6. Hand — A free individual private play area belonging to each player in the game. Empty at the start of the game. It contains cards available for the player to play.
			7. If an effect instructs a player to draw a card, that card is placed in the hand of the player drawing the card.
			8. Battlefield — A free shared open play area. At the start of the game, it contains cards of the type "City" from the common decks (see Section 4) of the players.
			9. Queue — An ordered shared open play area. Empty at the start of the game. When cards are played, they will pass through this play area.
				1. The queue has a beginning and an end, even if there are no cards or effects in it.
				2. Cards and effects that enter a queue always go to the end of the queue.
		6. If an effect refers to a private play zone but does not specify whose, the owner of the effect may choose any appropriate play zone.
2. Anatomy of cards and their rules
	1. Each card in Ascension has a set of distinctive details that describe its characteristics as a game component:

5. Game Structure
	1. Each game of Ascention consists of a setup phase, an initiative phase, a mulligan phase, a pre-effects phase, and rounds that repeat until one player or team is declared the winner.
	2. During the setup phase, players determine the initial positions of their decks in the play areas:
		1. Each player's main deck cards are shuffled separately and placed face down next to their owner to form their main deck.
		2. Each player's reinforcement deck cards are placed next to their main deck so that all players can consult them if needed.
		3. Each player's set of cities is placed on the battlefield in front of them.
	3. During the initiative phase, players roll the same set of dice (1d20 or 2d6). The player with the highest result chooses which player will go first. The order of the remaining players' turns is then determined, depending on whether the player has allies or not:
		1. If the player has allies, then the turns of the players will alternate between the teams (the order of the players' turns on the same team is determined by the collective decision of the team).
		2. If the player has no allies, then the turns will be passed from him to the players sitting to the left.
	4. During the mulligan phase, each player draws the top five cards of his main deck. Each player may then mulligan one card up to five times (see Section 6). The cards remaining in each player's hand after this are considered cards in the starting hand.
	5. During the pre-effect phase, any effects that are set to occur at the beginning of the game are triggered. Then, each player's supply value is set to the number of supply symbols on all of his cities.
	6. Each round of play consists of 5 phases:
		1. The Start of the Round phase, consisting of 3 steps:
			1. Draw Step - Each player with fewer cards in hand than their supply value draws a card. Each player with more cards in hand than their supply value discards one card until the number of cards in their hand equals their supply value.
			2. Gain Coins Step - Each player gains a number of coins equal to their supply value.
			3. Start of the Round Effects Step - All start of the round effects are triggered at the same time.
		2. Decree Phase, consisting of one step that repeats until no player can complete it:
			1. Decree Step - Starting with the player going first, each player issues one decree (see Section 6).
		3. Action Phase, consisting of player turns that repeat until every player passes. Each turn consists of the following phases:
			1. Start of Turn Effects Phase — All start of turn effects are triggered at the same time.

		4. Tactics Resolution Phase, in which the following actions are repeated for each tactic in the order they were played:
			1. The tactic determines which side has units with the greater total strength: the side of the player who declared the tactic or the player against whom the tactic was declared.
			2. If the side of the player who declared the tactic has greater strength, that player may do one of the following:
				1. Wound a Unit card assigned to that tactic or not assigned to the tactic at all; or a City card of the player against whom the tactic is assigned by an amount equal to the difference between the total strengths of the units on each side.
				2. Activate the tactic's Superiority ability.

			5. Units assigned to this tactic are removed from it.
			6. The tactic is put into the graveyard of the player who assigned it.
		5. The end of round phase, consisting of 1 step:
